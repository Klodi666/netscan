NetScan is a fast, multi-threaded network mapping and port scanning tool that helps system administrators, ethical hackers, and security professionals discover live hosts, open ports, and potentially vulnerable services on a network. It generates detailed HTML reports for easy visualization and sharing.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features
1. Fast Host Discovery

Scans single IPs, subnets (CIDR), or lists of IPs.

Detects live hosts quickly using TCP connect on common ports.

Helps identify which devices are active on the network.

2. Port Scanning

Multi-threaded scanning of configurable ports.

Identifies open, closed, or filtered ports.

Uses hundreds of concurrent threads for maximum speed.

3. Service Banner Detection

Captures service banners for open ports.

Reveals software types and versions running on devices.

Helps detect outdated or vulnerable services (SSH, HTTP, RDP, databases, etc.).

4. HTML Reporting

Generates visually clear HTML reports.

Includes color-coded tables for open/closed ports and banners.

Easy to share with colleagues or clients, no extra software required.

5. Configurable & Lightweight

Customizable ports, timeout, and thread count.

Runs on Windows, Linux, or macOS with Python 3.

No external dependencies required for basic scanning.

ðŸ”¹ Use Cases

Ethical Hackers & Pen Testers â†’ Quickly discover network devices and potential attack points.

Network Administrators â†’ Map network topology, find misconfigured devices, and secure exposed services.

Small & Medium Businesses â†’ Get affordable insight into network security without expensive enterprise tools.

ðŸ”¹ Advantages

Speed: Multi-threaded scanning allows rapid mapping of large networks.

Clarity: HTML reports make results easy to read and act on.

Flexibility: Works on single hosts, subnets, or large IP lists.

Foundational Tool: Can be extended into a SaaS platform for continuous monitoring or integrated into a full security dashboard.

If you want, I can create a next-level roadmap for NetScan showing how you could expand it into a full SaaS cybersecurity platform, including features like real-time traffic monitoring, alerts, and automated vulnerability reporting.
